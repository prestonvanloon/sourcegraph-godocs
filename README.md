# Sourcegraph Godocs Extension

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This extension adds a convenience link to godocs.org for the current package.

## Known Issues
File issues at [github.com/prestonvanloon/sourcegraph-godocs/issues](https://github.com/prestonvanloon/sourcegraph-godocs/issues).

- The godoc link does not update when navigating from file to some other directory. This seems to be lacking subscribable event in sourcegraph API.
